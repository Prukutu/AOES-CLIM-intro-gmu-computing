In atmosphere, ocean, and climate science most of our work is done on Unix or Linux computers. The AOES/COLA computers that you will use as a student are Linux computers. To do your research on these computers you need to know how to interact with the file system, including finding and access files for the datasets you will work with. These lessons will start you on the path for how to do this.

These lessons are based on The Carpentries, Software Carpentry Core Curriculum Lesson “The Unix Shell” with modifications specific to AOES/COLA computing systems when needed. They follow The Carpentries style using The Carpentries Lesson Template.
