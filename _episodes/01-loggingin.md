### Why do I need to login to COLA computers?
In atmosphere, ocean, and climate science most of our data analysis work is done on Unix or Linux computers. These types of computers have more computational capability and much more disk space than a laptop or home computer.  We need this to handle the many large datasets used in climate data analysis.  Additionally, COLA computers already contain the datasets we will work with.  These datasets are too large for your home computer and would take months to download. 


### COLA Computers

The Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA) in the Department of Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Earth Sciences (AOES) has Linux computers used to analysis of Climate Data.  They consist of cola1, cola2, cola3, ... , cola7.  These are the computers we will use in this class.  

### Setting up your computer

To login to the COLA computers, you need secure shell (ssh) software. The software differs based on what type of computer you have. 

## macOS
For a Mac computer, we will use software called [Xquartz](https://www.xquartz.org/)

## Windows
For a window computer, use [MobusXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
